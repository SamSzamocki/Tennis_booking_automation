## ‚è∞ Automated Monitoring (Cron)

To check every hour automatically:

1. **Open crontab**:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add this line** (replace `/path/to/` with your actual path):
   ```bash
   7 * * * * cd /path/to/Tennis_booking_automation && /bin/bash -c 'source venv/bin/activate && python watcher.py' >> monitor.log 2>&1
   ```

   This runs the monitor at 7 minutes past every hour and logs output to `monitor.log`.

3. **Alternative: Run every 30 minutes during peak hours**:
   ```bash
   # Check every 30 minutes between 7 AM and 10 PM
   0,30 7-22 * * * cd /path/to/Tennis_booking_automation && /bin/bash -c 'source venv/bin/activate && python watcher.py' >> monitor.log 2>&1
   ```

## üìÖ Updating the Date

The `WATCH_URL` contains a specific date. To monitor different dates:

1. **Manual update**: Edit the `.env` file and change the date in `WATCH_URL`
2. **Script for tomorrow**: Create a simple script to update the URL:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # update_date.sh
   TOMORROW=$(date -d "+1 day" +%Y-%m-%d)
   sed -i "s/2025-08-24/$TOMORROW/g" .env
   ```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Login fails**:
- Verify your Better/GLL credentials are correct
- Check if your account requires 2FA (may need manual intervention)
- Try running with `headless=False` in the script for debugging

**No slots detected**:
- The page structure may have changed - check the HTML parsing logic
- Verify the `WATCH_URL` is correct and accessible
- Run manually to see detailed output

**Email notifications not working**:
- Ensure you're using a Gmail App Password, not your regular password
- Check that 2-factor authentication is enabled on your Google account
- Verify SMTP settings are correct

**Cron job not running**:
- Check cron logs: `grep CRON /var/log/syslog` (Linux) or `log show --predicate 'process == "cron"'` (macOS)
- Ensure full paths are used in the crontab entry
- Check that the virtual environment activates correctly

### Debug Mode

To run with visible browser for debugging:
```python
# In watcher.py, change this line:
browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)  # Set to False
```

## üìù Exit Codes

- `0`: No available slots found (normal operation)
- `1`: Available slots found (triggers notifications)
- `2`: Error occurred (configuration or runtime error)

These exit codes are useful for cron job monitoring and alerting.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: The script checks hourly by default to be respectful of Better's servers
- **Terms of Service**: Review Better/GLL's terms of service regarding automated access
- **Personal Use**: This tool is intended for personal use to monitor availability
- **No Auto-booking**: The script only monitors and notifies; it does not automatically book courts

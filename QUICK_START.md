## ✅ **You're All Set!**

Your tennis court monitoring system is **active and running**:

- **🔄 Checks every 30 minutes** for available courts
- **📅 Always monitors today's date** automatically

2. **Notifications are Rare:** Courts are usually fully booked (this is normal!)
3. **Act Fast:** When you get notified, book immediately - courts go quickly
4. **Peak Times:** Most cancellations happen evening before next day
